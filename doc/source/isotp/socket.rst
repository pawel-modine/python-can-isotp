.. _Socket:

IsoTp Sockets
=============

Introduction
------------

Under Linux, CAN interfaces can be managed the same way as network interfaces. The support for each CAN driver is written directly in the Linux kernel, inside a module called SocketCAN. Therefore, it is possible to send data over CAN through sockets, which offer a unique interface for all CAN drivers.

SocketCAN allows a user the send data on the CAN layer only, which means that IsoTP protocol implementation has to be outside of the kernel, making timing requirements hard to meet. Fortunately, this `third party loadable kernel module <https://github.com/hartkopp/can-isotp>`_ addresses that issue by making an implementation that can be loaded within the Linux kernel and accessed through a socket as well.

A socket is a standard interface for communication protocols and as anything generic, it can be complex to configure. The ``isotp.socket``  is a wrapper over a native IsoTP socket providing a friendly and pythonic interface for easy configuration. It does not offer any additional functionality that your operating system can't provide, it makes the syntax clean and warns you in case of wrong usage.


Troubleshooting
---------------

 - **My socket module does not include the `CAN_ISOTP` constant**
 
That means that your Python version does not include support for IsoTP protocol. It should be included starting from Python 3.7, under Linux build only. See `Python issue <https://bugs.python.org/issue30987>`_ and `Pull request <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/2956>`_

 - **When I create the socket, I get `OSError [errno XX] : Protocol not supported`.**
 
The Loadable Kernel Module is not loaded in your Linux kernel. Follow the steps given it the module repository. You needs to compile the module, install the `.ko` file and then run `insmod can-isotp.ko` as Super User. Then your OS will accept to create an ISO-TP sockets.

.. code-block:: python

   SOL_CAN_ISOTP = 106 # These constants exist in the module header, not in Python.
   CAN_ISOTP_RECV_FC = 2
   # Many more exists.

   import socket
   import struct

   s = socket.socket(socket.AF_CAN, socket.SOCK_DGRAM, socket.CAN_ISOTP)
   s2 = socket.socket(socket.AF_CAN, socket.SOCK_DGRAM, socket.CAN_ISOTP)
   # Configuring the sockets with ugly struct.pack() that requires knowledge of the LKM structure
   s.setsockopt(SOL_CAN_ISOTP, CAN_ISOTP_RECV_FC, struct.pack("=BBB", 0x10, 3,0)) #bs, stmin, wftmax
   #s.setsockopt(SOL_CAN_ISOTP, CAN_ISOTP_OPTS, struct.pack(...))
   #s.setsockopt(SOL_CAN_ISOTP, CAN_ISOTP_LL_OPTS, struct.pack(...))

   s.bind(("vcan0", 0x123, 0x456)) #rxid, txid with confusing order.
   s2.bind(("vcan0", 0x456, 0x123)) #rxid, txid
   s2.send(b"Hello, this is a long payload sent in small chunks of 8 bytes.")
   print(s.recv(4095))

With this project
#################

.. code-block:: python

   import isotp

   s = isotp.socket()
   s2 = isotp.socket()
   # Configuring the sockets.
   s.set_fc_opts(stmin=5, bs=10)
   #s.set_general_opts(...)
   #s.set_ll_opts(...)

   s.bind("vcan0", isotp.Address(rxid=0x123, txid=0x456)) 
   s2.bind("vcan0", isotp.Address(rxid=0x456, txid=0x123))
   s2.send(b"Hello, this is a long payload sent in small chunks of 8 bytes.")
   print(s.recv())
